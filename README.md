# tid

A simple, CLI-based time tracking utility for personal time tracking. `tid` uses [Bolt][1] as a
storage backend, and does not require an active daemon.

## Installation

```
$ go get -u -v github.com/SeerUK/tid/...
```

## Usage

Full usage information can be seen by using the built-in contextual help. This can accessed by
running:

```
$ tid --help
$ # Or for command help:
$ tid start --help
```

Tid has sub-commands in some places, for example:

```
$ tid entry create 1h10m "Resolving live issue"
```

And also has short aliases for some commands:

```
$ tid e c 1h10m "Resolving live isssue"
```

Here's some simple general usage:

```
$ tid start "Working on AI"
Started timer for 'Working on AI' (fdb6f0d)

$ tid status
+------------+---------+------------+------------+---------------+----------+---------+
|    DATE    |  HASH   |  CREATED   |  UPDATED   |      NOTE     | DURATION | RUNNING |
+------------+---------+------------+------------+---------------+----------+---------+
| 2017-03-01 | fdb6f0d | 10:41:34AM | 10:41:34AM | Working on AI | 5s       | true    |
+------------+---------+------------+------------+---------------+----------+---------+

$ tid stop
Stopped timer for 'Working on AI' (fdb6f0d)

# Gone for lunch...

$ tid resume
Resumed timer for 'Working on AI' (fdb6f0d)

# Forgot to add this!

$ tid entry create 15m "Afternoon nap"
Created entry 'Afternoon nap' (3d77f69)

$ tid report
Report for 2017-03-01.

Total Duration: 2h34m37s
Entry Count: 1

+------------+---------+------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+---------+
|    DATE    |  HASH   |  CREATED   |  UPDATED  |      NOTE       | DURATION | RUNNING |
+------------+---------+------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+---------+
| 2017-03-01 | fdb6f0d | 10:41:34AM | 1:01:03PM | Working on AI   | 2h19m37s | true    |
+            +---------+------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+---------+
|            | 3d77f69 | 1:26:30PM  | 1:26:30PM | Afternoon nap   | 15m0s    | false   |
+------------+---------+------------+-----------+-----------------+----------+---------+
```

### Starting an Entry Timer `start`

```
$ tid start "A note"
```

The note is required, but can by any string value. It's used so when you view the status or the
report you know what you've been tracking. Try make it something identifiable. Maybe this will just
be an issue ID from your issue tracker?

### Stopping an Entry Timer `stop`

```
$ tid stop
```

Stop always stops the currently active timer, if you don't have an active timer, it won't do
anything.

### Resuming an Entry Timer `resume|res`

```
$ tid resume
$ tid resume fdb6f0d
```

The resume command allows you to resume the most recently stopped entry, or a specific entry by
passing in that entry's hash. If you don't have a most recently stopped entry then you would have to
pass in an entry hash to use resume (e.g. if you remove the entry being tracked).

### Status of an Entry `status|st`

```
$ tid status
$ tid status fdb6f0d
$ tid status --format="{{.Duration}} on '{{.Note}}'"
```

You can view the status of the currently tracked entry (the most recently started or resumed entry)
or you can view the status of a specific entry. The output is similar to the report output.

### Report your Timesheet `report|rep`

```
$ tid report
$ tid report --start=2017-02-01 --end=2017-02-28
$ tid report --start=(tiddate --months=-6)
$ tid report --no-summary
$ tid report --format="{{.Hash}} {{.Note}}" --no-summary
```

The report command is quite powerful and gives you a lot of different ways to view timesheet data.
By default the output will display a summary, and a table of the entries. You can control the output
by passing other options like `--format` which is useful for scripting.

### Management Commands

#### Entries `entry|e`

Sometimes you just forget to track something, and maybe it was a couple of days ago! Or maybe you
realised you've tracked some additional time by mistake. The entry management commands let you 
create new entries on the fly, or manage existing ones. There's also a listing that's similar to the
report view, but without the summary.

##### Create `create|c`

```
$ tid entry create <DURATION> <NOTE>
$ tid entry create 10m "Hello, World"
$ tid e c 10m "Hello, World"
```

##### Delete `delete|d`

```
$ tid entry delete <HASH>
$ tid entry delete c24543c
$ tid e d c24543c
```

##### List `list|ls`

```
$ tid entry list [OPTIONS]
$ tid entry list --start=(tiddate --days=-7) --end=(tiddate) --format="{{.Hash}}"
$ tid entry list --date=(tiddate --days=-7)
$ tid e ls 
```

The `--format` options uses Go's `text/template` package, and is passed an [Entry][entry]. 

##### Update `update|u`

```
$ tid entry delete <HASH>
$ tid entry delete c24543c
$ tid e d c24543c
```

#### Timesheets

##### Delete `delete|d`
##### List `list|ls`

#### Workspaces

##### Create `create|c`
##### Delete `delete|d`
##### List `list|ls`
##### Switch `switch|s`

### Adding an Entry

```
$ tid add 2001-01-01 24h "Welcome to the 21st century!"
$ tid add (tiddate --days=-1) 1h10m "Call with Google"
```

### Editing an Entry

```
$ tid edit fdb6f0d --duration=30s
$ tid edit fdb6f0d --note="Working on AI killer"
$ tid edit fdb6f0d --offset=1m
```

People make mistakes, and you probably will when tracking your time too. You can update the note, or
the duration of an entry easily with the edit command. If you specify an `--offset` it will add that
to the duration (you can specify negative offsets to subtract time too, like `--offset=-12s`). You
cannot specify both a duration and an offset at the same time.

### Removing an Entry

```
$ tid remove fdb6f0d
```

Removing will permantently delete an entry. If the entry is running, you will be returned to a
stopped state. If it was being tracked most recently, you will no longer have any entry to resume.

##Â Completions

Completions are provided for Fish and are located with obvious names in the `completions/` 
directory. Installation will probably look something like this:

```
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions/
$ cp completions/tid.fish ~/.config/fish/completions/
```

Completion covers commands, options of commands, and entries where applicable.
