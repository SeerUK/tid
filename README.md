# tid

A simple, CLI-based time tracking utility - because Tempo and JIRA suck. `tid` uses sqlite for the
database, and does not use any kind of active daemon. Updates should be handled gracefully via
migrations.

## Installation

```
$ go install github.com/SeerUK/tid/...
```

##Â Usage

Full usage information can be seen by using the built-in contextual help. This can accessed by 
running:
 
```
$ tid --help
$ # Or for command help:
$ tid start --help
```

Starting a timer:

```
$ tid start "A note"
```

Stopping a timer:

```
$ tid stop
```
